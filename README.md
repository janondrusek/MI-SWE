This JS application can be applied on any website, that contains text. It extracts text from headlines
and paragraphs, uses Yahoo Term Extraction API to discover what is given text about and tries to find similar
articles using search engines APIs (Google, Yahoo, Bing, ... whatever).

It was created as a semestral work at CTU FIT in Prague, subjects MI-NUR (UI, Návrh uživatelských rozhraní)
and MI-SWE (Semantic web, Semantický web).
